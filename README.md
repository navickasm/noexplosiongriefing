# noexplosiongriefing
A simple Spigot plugin that prevents certain types of explosions (soon to be customizable) from breaking certain blocks.

Currently, all blocks are prevented from destruction from creeper explosions only, as that is what my friend's SMP wanted.

## Installation
Navigate to releases on the right, choose the latest release for your version (currently, only 1.21.1 is supported, but extensive compatibility will be ensured in the future),
and drag it into your server's `plugins` folder.
